                    <p className="section-text">
                        Copyright registration is a legal process that grants creators of original works exclusive rights over their creations. These works can include literature, music, art, films, and more. Copyright helps protect the creator's work from unauthorized use and ensures they can control how their work is used and distributed.

                    <ul className="section-text">
                        <li><strong>Legal Protection:</strong> Registration provides legal evidence of ownership and the ability to enforce your rights in court. This includes the right to sue for infringement and seek damages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Public Record:</strong> Registration creates a public record of your copyright claim, making it easier to establish and prove ownership.</li>

                        <li><strong>International Protection:</strong> Through international treaties, a registered copyright can help protect your work in other countries.</li>

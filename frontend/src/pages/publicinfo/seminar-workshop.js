                    <p className="section-text">
                        Seminars and workshops are structured learning sessions designed to educate and engage participants on specific topics or skills. While both are forms of educational events, they serve slightly different purposes. Seminars are typically informative sessions led by an expert or a panel, where attendees learn about a particular subject. Workshops, on the other hand, are more interactive and hands-on, allowing participants to actively engage in exercises, discussions, and activities related to the topic.

                    <p className="section-text">
                        While both seminars and workshops aim to educate, they differ in format, delivery, and outcomes:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="section-text">
                        <li><strong>Format:</strong> Seminars are often lecture-based, with a focus on providing information, while workshops are interactive and involve hands-on activities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Seminars may last for a few hours to a full day, while workshops can range from a few hours to several days, depending on the depth of the topic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Audience Interaction:</strong> Seminars typically have limited audience interaction, with opportunities for Q&A sessions, whereas workshops emphasize participant interaction, collaboration, and practical exercises.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The primary outcome of a seminar is to impart knowledge, whereas the outcome of a workshop is to equip participants with practical skills they can apply immediately.</li>
